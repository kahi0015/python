Mini Python Projects.

During my first python course, I had the chance to practice some coding activities. In this reporsitory, some of those mini codes written are:

- How to connect Python to MYSQL DB:
    - Creating virtual workspace,
            Execute command:
            python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment/mysql-workspace

    - Activating virtual workspace & Installing mysql-connector-python,
            Activate the workspace:
            F:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat

            If you have PIP3, write:
            pip3 install mysql-connector-python

    - Testing connectivity to MYSQL (refer to connect_mysql.py):
        - Creation of db, and table, inserting a record, and 
        - Accessing that db named ‘pythondb’

- Drawing shapes (Square, triangle, and a circle)

- Draw a square in terminal (using loop)

- Reading and writing to a file; deleting a file
